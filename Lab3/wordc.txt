Decision trees are a very effective method of supervised learning. it aims is the partition of a dataset into groups as homogeneous as possible in terms of the variable to be predicted. it takes as input a set of classified data, and outputs a input text data tree that resembles an orientation diagram where each end node leaf is a decision a class and each non final node internal represents a test. Each leaf represents the decision of belonging to a class of data verifying all tests path from the root to the leaf.
